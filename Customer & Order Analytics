#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales GROUP BY product;

#How many of each product were sold?
SELECT sum(quantity), price, product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales GROUP BY product, price;

"To show the quantity of each product sold * the price of each product.
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product FROM BIT_DB.JanSales GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
